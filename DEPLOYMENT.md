## Troubleshooting

**Build Fails:**
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is configured
- Check that all dependencies are installed

**Routing Issues:**
- The `_redirects` file handles SPA routing
- All routes redirect to `index.html` for client-side routing

**Animation Performance:**
- Animations are CSS-based for optimal performance
