# Netlify Deployment Setup Guide

## Current Issue Resolution

The 404 error occurs because Netlify can't find the required files. Here's how to fix it:

### 1. Build Configuration Fixed
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (builds the complete frontend)
- **Publish Directory**: `dist/public` (contains the generated files)
- **Node Version**: 18

### 2. Repository Structure
Your current repo needs to be structured for frontend-only deployment:

```
my_portfolio/
├── client/              # Frontend code
├── dist/public/         # Built files (generated)
├── netlify.toml         # Netlify config
├── package.json         # Dependencies
└── _redirects          # SPA routing
```

### 3. What to Upload to GitHub

Upload these key files/folders:
- `client/` (complete frontend code)
- `netlify.toml` (deployment config)
- `package.json` (dependencies)
- `tailwind.config.ts` (styling config)
- `postcss.config.js` (CSS processing)
- `vite.config.ts` (build config)

**DO NOT UPLOAD:**
- `server/` folder (backend code)
- `node_modules/` (dependencies)
- `dist/` folder (built files - generated by Netlify)

### 4. Netlify Settings

In your Netlify dashboard, set:
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist/public`
- **Node version**: 18

### 5. Deploy Process

1. Push the frontend-only code to GitHub
2. Netlify builds using `npm run build`
3. Generated files in `dist/public/` are served
4. SPA routing works via `_redirects` file

### 6. Verification

After deployment, check:
- `your-site.netlify.app` loads the main page
- Language switching works
- Project navigation works
- Contact form works

The build generates these essential files:
- `index.html` (main page)
- `assets/index-[hash].js` (JavaScript bundle)
- `assets/index-[hash].css` (CSS bundle)
- All project images and assets
